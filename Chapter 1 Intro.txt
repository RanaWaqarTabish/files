Introduction:The poultry industry has relied heavily on antibacterial growth promoters (AGP) to enhance production efficiency and control enteric diseases (Gadde et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2021). However, the global trend toward restricting AGP use has led to increased incidence of enteric diseases, particularly those involving Clostridium perfringens, resulting in significant economic losses (Rood et al., 2016; Kaldhusdal et al., 2016; Timbermont et al., 2011). Intestinal disorders associated with C. perfringens are often predisposed by Eimeria infections, creating a co-infection scenario that disrupts intestinal integrity, leading to impaired nutrient absorption and reduced growth performance (Moore, 2016; Wade and Keyburn, 2015; M'Sadeq et al., 2015). While Part 1 of this study focused on performance, tibia mineralization, and nutrient digestibility in broilers challenged with Eimeria and C. perfringens (Gulizia et al., 2025), this second part examines the microbiological, histopathological, and molecular responses of broilers subjected to the same co-infection challenge and dietary treatments.The gastrointestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in nutrient digestion, immune modulation, and pathogen exclusion in poultry (Oakley et al., 2014; Pan and Yu, 2014). Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, often precedes clinical manifestations of enteric diseases (Antonissen et al., 2016; Ducatelle et al., 2018). Recent studies have demonstrated that dietary calcium concentration and solubility can significantly influence gut microbiota composition and function (Borda-Molina et al., 2018; Witzig et al., 2015). Calcium, beyond its role in bone mineralization, serves as a signaling molecule in microbial communities and affects bacterial adhesion to intestinal mucosa (Mann et al., 2014; De Maesschalck et al., 2015). Unabsorbed dietary calcium can form insoluble complexes with fatty acids in the intestinal lumen, potentially altering microbial community structure (Dittoe et al., 2018; Walk et al., 2012).Limestone particle size directly influences calcium solubility and release patterns in the gastrointestinal tract of broilers (Kim et al., 2018; Anwar et al., 2017). Larger limestone particles (>500 ?m) typically exhibit slower dissolution rates compared to finely ground particles (<300 ?m), potentially modifying the luminal calcium gradient along the intestinal tract (Zhang and Coon, 1997; Kim et al., 2019). This gradient may selectively favor certain bacterial populations while inhibiting others, particularly during enteric challenges (Bortoluzzi et al., 2018; Alabdeh et al., 2020). Wilkinson et al. (2020) reported that coarse limestone particles led to reduced C. perfringens colonization compared to fine particles during an experimental Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection, possibly due to altered pH conditions in the upper intestinal segments.The intestinal mucosa serves as the primary interface between the host and its microbiota, with dynamic transcriptional responses to both pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms (Jia et al., 2019; Oakley and Kogut, 2016). The mucosal transcriptome reflects the host's adaptive responses to microbial challenges and nutritional interventions (Kogut et al., 2018; Rychlik, 2020). Several studies have demonstrated that calcium homeostasis genes are differentially expressed during Eimeria and C. perfringens challenges (Truong et al., 2017; Dersjant-Li et al., 2016). Lu et al. (2019) reported that dietary calcium concentration influenced the expression of immune-related genes in the jejunal mucosa of broilers, suggesting a direct link between calcium nutrition and host inflammatory responses. Similarly, Oh et al. (2018) observed that calcium source and particle size affected the expression of tight junction proteins, which are crucial for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity during enteric challenges.Histopathological assessment remains essential for characterizing intestinal lesions during enteric diseases and evaluating the efficacy of nutritional interventions (Prescott et al., 2016; Shojadoost et al., 2012). The jejunum, being a primary site for nutrient absorption and frequently affected during Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infections (Cooper and Songer, 2009; Williams, 2005), requires particular attention. Previous studies have reported varying degrees of jejunal lesions depending on calcium concentration in the diet during Eimeria challenges (Paiva et al., 2013; Tactacan et al., 2016). Chen et al. (2019) observed that broilers fed diets with reduced calcium levels exhibited less severe intestinal lesions following an Eimeria challenge compared to those fed standard calcium levels. However, the interactive effects of limestone particle size and calcium concentration on jejunal histopathology during an Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection remain poorly understood.Despite the accumulated evidence suggesting potential effects of dietary calcium manipulation on gut health parameters, comprehensive studies examining the interrelationships between calcium nutrition, gut microbiota, mucosal transcriptome, and histopathology during Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection are limited (Broom, 2017; Marquis et al., 2021). The results from Part 1 of this study indicated that calcium concentration and limestone particle size influenced broiler performance and nutrient digestibility during an Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection challenge (Gulizia et al., 2025). However, the underlying mechanisms involving microbial, molecular, and histological changes remain to be elucidated.Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of limestone particle size (910 and 200 ?m) and calcium concentrations (adequate, reduced, and low) on jejunal microbiota composition, cecal and jejunal mucosal transcriptome profiles, and jejunal histopathology in broilers subjected to an Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection challenge. We hypothesized that larger limestone particles combined with moderate reductions in dietary calcium concentration would maintain beneficial microbiota profiles, promote favorable mucosal gene expression patterns, and reduce intestinal lesion severity during this co-infection challenge.REFERENCES:Alabdeh, M., Ca–ibe, N., Poulsen, H.D., Nielsen, D.S., 2020.
