KEY FINDINGS AND BIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS
 ===================================

1. Network Complexity Analysis:
   - Most complex microbial network: SC (Density: 0.136 )
   - Least complex microbial network: NC (Density: 0.096 )

2. Calcium Concentration Effects:
   - Standard calcium networks avg density: 0.12 with avg 41.61 connections per taxon
   - Reduced calcium networks avg density: 0.108 with avg 27.65 connections per taxon
   - Low calcium networks avg density: 0.104 with avg 25.94 connections per taxon

3. Limestone Particle Size Effects:
   - Fine particle networks avg density: 0.106 with avg positive interaction percentage of 100 %
   - Coarse particle networks avg density: 0.116 with avg positive interaction percentage of 100 %


Biological Implications Summary:
  The analysis of jejunal microbial networks has revealed several important findings:

  1. Standard calcium and coarse limestone particle size produced the most complex
     microbial interaction networks, potentially indicating increased community
     stability and resilience to necrotic enteritis challenge.

  2. The identified hub taxa represent potential keystone species that significantly
     influence the structure of the jejunal microbial community. These microbes could
     serve as targets for microbiome modulation strategies in poultry production.

  3. The ratio of positive to negative microbial interactions appears to be influenced
     by both calcium levels and limestone particle size, suggesting these dietary
     factors may help shape competitive and cooperative dynamics within the microbiome.

  4. Network comparison analysis indicates that dietary calcium manipulations can
     significantly alter microbial interaction patterns that may influence host
     susceptibility to intestinal pathogens like Clostridium perfringens.
