Jejunal Histopathology and MorphometryHistopathological examination of jejunal segments revealed distinct differences across treatment groups. Coccidia infestation (primarily Eimeria maxima) showed a marked contrast between the NC group and all treatment groups. The NC group exhibited minimal coccidia presence (0.03 ± 0.19), while treatment groups displayed significantly higher scores ranging from 4.43 ± 1.10 to 4.77 ± 0.63. All treatment groups had comparable coccidia scores regardless of calcium level or particle size.Villus tips with moderate to severe misshaping were entirely absent in the NC group (0.00 ± 0.00) but widespread in treatment groups. The SF and RC groups showed the highest misshaping scores (both 3.53 ± 1.61 and 3.53 ± 1.50, respectively), while the LC group displayed a somewhat lower score (2.77 ± 1.91). The LF and SC groups had identical scores (both 3.37 ± 1.59), with RF showing the lowest score among treatment groups (2.73 ± 1.96). Vascular congestion in the lamina propria was significantly lower in the NC group (0.59 ± 0.68) compared to treatment groups. Among treatments, the SF and RC groups exhibited the highest congestion scores (1.37 ± 1.10 and 1.33 ± 0.76, respectively), while the SC group showed the lowest (1.07 ± 0.87). Focal hemorrhage was observed only occasionally in the RF (0.07 ± 0.37) and SC (0.03 ± 0.18) groups.Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) development was measurably lower in the NC group (4.31 ± 0.89) compared to all treatment groups (4.97-5.33). The RC and LC groups showed the highest GALT scores (both 5.33), while the LF group had the lowest among treatments (4.97 ± 0.85). Intraepithelial lymphocytes were present across all groups with slightly higher scores in SC and LC groups (both 2.53) compared to the NC group (2.21), though these differences did not reach statistical significance. Similarly, goblet cell hyperplasia showed no significant differences between groups. Occasional cystic crypts were observed in RF, SC, and RC groups (all 0.03 ± 0.18), while villus atrophy and necrotic enteritis were absent across all specimens. The cumulative pathology score (excluding coccidia) revealed clear differences between the NC group (5.66 ± 1.90) and all treatment groups (9.70-11.30). Among treatments, the SF group showed the highest pathology score (11.30 ± 2.98), while the LC group displayed the lowest (9.70 ± 2.74).Villus length measurements confirmed significant differences between groups. The NC group had substantially longer villi (526 ± 141 ?m) compared to all treatment groups. Among treatments, the LC group maintained longer villi (498 ± 152 ?m), while the RC group had the shortest (413 ± 158 ?m). The RF group also showed relatively shorter villi (419 ± 139 ?m) compared to other treatments. Crypt depth measurements revealed an opposite pattern, with the NC group having markedly shallower crypts (260 ± 80 ?m) compared to all treatment groups. Among treatments, crypt depths were fairly similar, ranging from 325 ± 74 ?m (RF) to 342 ± 80 ?m (RC). The villus-to-crypt ratio showed significant variation, with the NC group having a substantially higher ratio (2.18 ± 0.79) than all treatment groups. Within treatments, the LC group maintained the highest ratio (1.58 ± 0.56), while the RC group had the lowest (1.27 ± 0.56).These morphometric parameters align with the histopathological observations, providing quantitative evidence of the differences in jejunal architecture across treatment groups. The NC group consistently displayed favorable intestinal morphology, while treatment groups showed varying degrees of alteration in villus height, crypt depth, and their ratio, with the LC group generally exhibiting the most favorable metrics among all treatment groups.
