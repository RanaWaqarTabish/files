Response of broilers subjected to an enteric challenge and fed diets with varying limestone particle sizes and calcium concentrations-part 2: histopathology, microbiota, and intestinal transcriptomeAbstractEnteric diseases predisposed by challenges like Eimeria spp. and Clostridium perfringens co-infection compromise poultry health and performance, particularly as antibiotic growth promoter use declines. Dietary calcium influences gut homeostasis, but the interactive effects of calcium concentration and limestone particle size during such challenges require further investigation. Here, we integrated jejunal histopathology, jejunal microbiota analysis with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and functional prediction, and jejunal and cecal intestinal mucosal transcriptomics with mRNA-Seq to evaluate how varying dietary calcium levels (adequate, reduced, low) and limestone particle sizes (coarse vs. fine) modulate gut responses in broilers subjected to an Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection. The challenge induced significant jejunal lesions (P < 0.001), microbial dysbiosis including reduced richness (P = 0.001) and altered community structure (PERMANOVA P = 0.001), and extensive, intestinal segment specific transcriptional reprogramming. Adequate dietary calcium supported higher microbial richness (P = 0.037) and abundances of beneficial taxa like Lactobacillus and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (Padj < 0.001). Coarse limestone particle diets, particularly at adequate calcium levels, enhanced predicted jejunal butyrate metabolism (P < 0.001) and were associated with upregulated host jejunal immune pathways compared to fine particle diets. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct cell proliferative response in the jejunum and an immune-focused response in the cecum following the challenge, both of which were further modulated by dietary calcium levels and limestone particle size, including reciprocal adaptations between intestinal segments under calcium restriction. Our findings demonstrate that dietary calcium concentration and limestone particle size orchestrate intestinal segment specific microbial community structure, host transcriptional programs, and gut health outcomes during enteric challenge, highlighting potential nutritional strategies to enhance gut resilience.Key words: calcium particle size, gut microbiota, mucosal transcriptome, necrotic enteritis, broilerIntroductionThe global shift away from antibacterial growth promoters (AGPs) in poultry production, driven by concerns over antimicrobial resistance, presents significant challenges to maintaining gut health and preventing enteric diseases (Gadde et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2021). This transition has led to a re-emergence of complex intestinal disorders, notably necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens, often exacerbated by predisposing infections such as coccidiosis caused by Eimeria spp. (Kaldhusdal et al., 2016; Rood et al., 2018; Timbermont et al., 2011). This co-infection scenario severely disrupts intestinal homeostasis, impairing nutrient absorption and compromising broiler growth performance, resulting in estimated annual economic losses exceeding US$6 billion worldwide (Wade & Keyburn, 2015). Addressing this challenge necessitates a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between diet, the gut microbiota, and the host intestinal mucosal response. While Part 1 (Gulizia et al., 2025) of this study established the impact of dietary calcium manipulations on broiler performance, tibia mineralization, and nutrient digestibility during such a co-infection, this part delves into the underlying biological mechanisms by examining the jejunal microbiota, mucosal transcriptomic profiles of jejunum and cecum, and jejunal histopathology.The gastrointestinal microbiota functions as a complex ecological system crucial for nutrient metabolism, immune system development, and colonization resistance against pathogens in poultry (Oakley et al., 2014; Pan & Yu, 2014). Disturbances to this delicate balance, termed dysbiosis, characterized by shifts like reductions in butyrate producing families such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, alongside altered Lactobacillus populations (Antonissen et al., 2016), are increasingly recognized as precursors or contributors to enteric diseases (Antonissen et al., 2016; Ducatelle et al., 2018). Dietary components are potent modulators of this ecosystem. Specifically, dietary calcium, beyond its essential role in skeletal development, influences microbial communities through direct effects and indirect mechanisms, such as altering luminal pH or forming calcium-fatty acid soaps (Borda-Molina et al., 2018; De Maesschalck et al., 2015; Dittoe et al., 2018; Mann et al., 2014; Walk et al., 2012; Witzig et al., 2015). Furthermore, the characteristics of the calcium source, particularly limestone particle size, determine its solubility and release kinetics along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These properties influence gizzard retention and subsequent intestinal availability (Kim et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Zhang & Coon, 1997). Coarser particles, typically exceeding 500 ?m, dissolve more slowly than finer particles, often below 300 ?m, potentially establishing distinct luminal environments and impacting microbial niche availability and community structure (Kim et al., 2019; Zhang & Coon, 1997). Wilkinson et al. (Wilkinson et al., 2017) reported reduced C. perfringens colonization in turkeys fed coarse limestone particles during co-infection, possibly via pH modulation. Similarly, Paiva et al. (Paiva et al., 2013) observed that both calcium level and source influenced bird performance and mineral digestibility during a natural NE episode, highlighting the relevance of calcium characteristics in disease contexts and hinting at a complex role for calcium source properties in pathogen control (Paiva et al., 2013; Bortoluzzi et al., 2018).The host intestinal mucosa actively responds to both the microbiota and dietary inputs through complex signaling and transcriptional regulation (Jia et al., 2019; Kogut et al., 2018; Oakley & Kogut, 2016; Rychlik, 2020). Understanding these mucosal responses is key to deciphering gut health dynamics. Previous work using high-throughput sequencing has demonstrated that Eimeria and C. perfringens infections significantly alter host gene expression profiles related to immunity and metabolism (Jia et al., 2019; Truong et al., 2017). For instance, Truong et al. (Truong et al., 2017) identified differing immune response pathways in the intestinal mucosa of chicken lines challenged with NE. Moreover, dietary calcium levels themselves can modulate the expression of key host genes; Lu et al. (Lu et al., 2019) suggested an influence of dietary calcium on immune related gene expression, while Oh et al. (Oh et al., 2018) observed that calcium source and particle size affected the expression of tight junction proteins crucial for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. These findings suggest direct links between mineral nutrition and mucosal defense and integrity. Histopathological analysis provides complementary, tangible evidence of tissue damage and repair processes, quantifying the impact of disease and interventions on intestinal architecture (Prescott et al., 2016; Shojadoost et al., 2012). Given that the jejunum is a primary site for nutrient absorption and often severely affected by NE and coccidiosis (Cooper & Songer, 2009; Williams, 2005), its structural integrity, often assessed via metrics including the villus height to crypt depth ratio (Ducatelle et al., 2018), is paramount, and studies have shown its morphology is sensitive to dietary calcium levels during Eimeria challenge, with reduced calcium sometimes associated with lower lesion scores (Paiva et al., 2013; Paiva et al., 2013; Tactacan et al., 2016).However, despite these individual lines of evidence, a comprehensive understanding of how dietary calcium concentration and limestone particle size interactively shape the gut ecosystem encompassing the microbiota, host transcriptional responses in different gut segments like jejunum and cecum, and resulting tissue pathology during a clinically relevant Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection remains elusive (Broom, 2017). Integrating these multiple layers of biological information is crucial for developing effective, targeted nutritional strategies in the post-AGP era. Building upon the performance and digestibility findings reported in Part 1 (Gulizia et al., 2025), which demonstrated significant effects of these dietary factors, this study employs a multi-faceted approach to dissect these interactions.Therefore, we investigated the effects of varying limestone particle size, specifically 910 versus 200 ?m geometric mean diameter, and dietary calcium concentrations designated as adequate (0.90%), reduced (0.75%), and low (0.60%), on jejunal microbiota composition via 16S rRNA sequencing and predicted function using PICRUSt2, jejunal and cecal mucosal transcriptomes via mRNA-Seq, and jejunal histopathology through microscopic lesion scoring and morphometrics in broilers subjected to an Eimeria spp. and C. perfringens co-infection. We hypothesized that manipulating calcium availability through particle size and concentration would significantly alter gut microbiota structure, affecting the abundance of key genera like Lactobacillus and Clostridium, and microbial function, including butyrate metabolism pathways. We further hypothesized this would trigger distinct host transcriptional programs related to immunity, metabolism, and barrier function in the jejunum and cecum, and consequently influence the severity of intestinal lesions, including villus damage and GALT development, with coarser particles potentially offering protective advantages under specific calcium concentrations.Materials and MethodsExperimental Design, Animals, and HousingAll animal procedures received approval from the Auburn University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (PRN 2023-5159) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (BUA #984). This study utilized a 2 ? 3 + 1 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design, comparing two limestone particle sizes (coarse, 910 µm; fine, 200 µm) across three dietary calcium levels (Adequate, Reduced, Low). An unchallenged negative control (NC) group, fed the Adequate Ca, fine (200 µm) limestone diet, was included for comparison. A total of 2,100 one-day-old male YPM ? Ross 708 broiler chicks (Aviagen North America) were randomly assigned to these seven treatments, with 10 replicate floor pens per treatment and 30 birds per pen. Birds were housed in floor pens (2.79 m?) containing pine shavings, equipped with a tube feeder and a nipple drinker line. Environmental conditions, including temperature and lighting, adhered to Ross 708 management guidelines (Aviagen, 2022). Feed and water were provided ad libitum throughout the study.DietsCorn-soybean meal based diets were formulated to meet or exceed Ross 708 nutrient requirements (Aviagen, 2022), with calcium levels adjusted per treatment specifications. A three-phase feeding program was employed: starter (d 1-17), grower (d 18-26), and finisher (d 27-35). Within each phase, calcium levels (%) were set for the Adequate, Reduced, and Low treatments, respectively, as follows: starter phase (0.95%, 0.85%, 0.75%), grower phase (0.85%, 0.75%, 0.65%), and finisher phase (0.75%, 0.65%, 0.55%). Limestone was ground and sieved to achieve the target, which was verified by sieve analysis. Phytase (Quantum Blue 5 G, AB Vista, Marlborough, Wiltshire, UK) was included in all diets at 1,500 FTU/kg. Further diet composition details are available in the companion paper (Gulizia et al., 2025).Enteric Challenge ModelTo induce an enteric challenge, birds in the six challenged treatment groups were orally gavaged on day 14 with 1 mL of a commercial trivalent coccidial vaccine (Advent®, Huvepharma) administered at 10 times the manufacturer's recommended dose and containing viable oocysts of Eimeria acervulina, E. maxima, and E. tenella. Birds in the unchallenged control (NC) group received 1 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Following a dietary transition from starter to grower feed on day 17, birds in the challenged groups were subsequently gavaged on day 18 with 1 mL of a BHI broth culture containing Clostridium perfringens (1 ? 10? CFU/mL). The inoculum was prepared following modified methods of Wu et al. (Wu et al., 2010). Birds in the NC group received a sham gavage of 1 mL of sterile brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD).Sample CollectionOn day 21 (3 days post-C. perfringens challenge), eight birds per pen were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation in accordance with AVMA guidelines (AVMA, 2020). For histological analysis, a 2 cm mid-jejunal segment 5 cm proximal to Meckel’s diverticulum was collected from 3 birds per pen and immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for at least 24 h before processing. For microbiota analysis, jejunal contents (2 g) were collected from one bird per pen, immediately placed on ice, and stored at -80°C. For transcriptome analysis, mucosal scrapings from 5–10 cm segments of the jejunum and cecum were collected from one bird per pen, preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen), incubated at 4°C for 24 hours, then drained and stored at -80°C until further processing.Histological ExaminationFixed jejunal tissues were routinely processed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5 µm, and stained with H&E (Luna, 1968). Stained slides were digitally scanned (DP600, Ventana). Using the scanned images, morphometric measurements including villus height, crypt depth, villus width, and villus surface area were performed on 10 well oriented villi and crypts per sample using ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012) by an observer blinded to treatments. Additionally, a board-certified veterinary pathologist, also blinded to treatments, evaluated histopathology using a modified 0-5 scoring system (0=normal to 5=severe) (Gholamiandehkordi et al., 2007). Parameters assessed included coccidial presence, villus atrophy or fusion, crypt hyperplasia, lamina propria gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), lamina propria inflammatory cell infiltration including lymphocytes and heterophils, dysbacteriosis, necrotic enteritis lesions, cystic crypts or cryptitis, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), goblet cell density and mucus, misshaped villus tips, congestion, and hemorrhage. A cumulative pathology score, calculated as the sum of all lesion scores except coccidia, and a cumulative immune response score, representing the sum of GALT and IEL scores, were determined for each sample.Jejunal Microbiota Analysis (16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing)Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 mg of jejunal content using a QIAamp DNA Stool Kit (Qiagen) following standard protocol. DNA concentration and purity were confirmed (Nanodrop 2000, Qubit 4.0). The V4-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primers 515F (Caporaso et al., 2011) and 926R (Parada et al., 2016). Purified PCR products (400-450 bp) were sequenced (Illumina MiSeq, v3, 2 ? 300 bp) at the University of Illinois Chicago Genomics Research Core. Raw sequence data were deposited in the NCBI SRA (Accession: XXX).Sequencing data was initially processed using the QIIME2 v2022.11 framework (Bolyen et al., 2019). After quality checking (FastQC (Andrews, 2010)) and adapter trimming (Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014)), reads were denoised, filtered, and merged into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016). Taxonomy was assigned against the SILVA v138 database (Quast et al., 2013). For diversity analyses, samples were rarefied to 24,791 reads. Alpha diversity metrics, including Observed Features, Shannon, Simpson, and Fisher indices, were calculated using the estimate richness function in the phyloseq package in R v4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023). Beta diversity was assessed by calculating multiple distance matrices (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, weighted and unweighted UniFrac) using the distance function in phyloseq, followed by Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) for visualization. Differentially abundant ASVs between treatment groups were identified using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) (Padj < 0.05). Potential metagenome functions were inferred using PICRUSt2 v2.5.0 (Douglas et al., 2020), mapping predicted KEGG Orthologies (KOs) to KEGG pathways (Kanehisa et al., 2017). Differential pathway abundance was assessed using DESeq2.Transcriptome Analysis (mRNA-Seq)Total RNA was extracted from 15 mg jejunal and cecal mucosal tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with bead mill homogenization and on-column DNase treatment. RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), ensuring A260/280 ratios > 2.0 and A260/230 ratios > 1.8. RNA integrity was verified using an Agilent 5400 Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA); samples with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 4.0 were considered acceptable for transcriptome analysis. mRNA-Seq libraries were constructed from 1 µg total RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB), involving poly-A selection, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification (12 cycles). Library quality was confirmed (Qubit 4, Agilent 5400) before pooling and sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform (150 bp paired-end, target about 30 million read pairs/sample) by Novogene Corporation Inc. Raw sequence data were deposited in the NCBI SRA (Accession: XXX).Bioinformatic processing began with quality control using FastQC (Andrews, 2010) followed by adapter and quality trimming using Trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014). Clean reads were aligned to the Gallus gallus reference genome (GRCg7b) using HISAT2 v2.2.0 (Kim et al., 2019). Gene level read counts were obtained using HTSeq-count v1.13.3 (Anders et al., 2015). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 in R v4.3.1. Briefly, count data were imported into a DESeqDataSet object, and the standard DESeq2 workflow involving normalization, dispersion estimation, and Wald testing was executed using the DESeq() function. Pairwise comparisons between specified treatment groups were extracted using the results() function to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs: Padj < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1). For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), gene lists were ranked based on the metric sign (log2FoldChange) ? -log10(Pvalue) derived from the DESeq2 results for each comparison. GSEA was then performed on these ranked lists to identify significantly enriched biological pathways (FDR < 0.05).Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using R software v4.3.1. The pen served as the experimental unit. Data normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed prior to analysis. Alpha diversity metrics, histopathology scores, and morphometric data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn's post-hoc test with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction for pairwise comparisons. Beta diversity significance was evaluated using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) via the adonis2 function (vegan package) on Bray-Curtis distance matrices with 9,999 permutations. Pairwise PERMANOVA comparisons between groups were conducted using the pairwise.adonis2 function with BH correction. For all tests, significance was declared at P ≤ 0.05.Results and DiscussionEnteric challenge induces jejunal lesions and alters morphologyJejunal histopathology scores and morphometric measurements are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The Eimeria spp. and C. perfringens co-infection model successfully induced significant pathological changes compared to the unchallenged negative control (NC), based on Kruskal-Wallis tests. Coccidia scores were significantly higher in all challenged groups (mean scores 4.43-4.77) compared to the NC group (mean 0.03; P < 0.001; Fig. 2A), confirming infection consistent with the challenge administration (Williams, 2005). This was associated with significant intestinal damage; cumulative pathology scores (excluding coccidia) were markedly elevated in all challenged groups (means 9.70-11.30) versus the NC group (mean 5.66; P < 0.001; Fig. 2D). Specific lesions significantly increased by the challenge included villus tip misshaping (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B) and vascular congestion (overall P = 0.024; Fig. 2B), with post-hoc tests indicating significant differences between NC and AF (P = 0.037) and NC and RC (P = 0.025). Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) scores were also higher in challenged groups compared to NC (overall P < 0.001; Fig. 2C), indicating immune activation (Gholamiandehkordi et al., 2007).Morphometrically, the challenge significantly reduced villus height (overall P = 0.045; Fig. 3A) and increased crypt depth (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B) in challenged groups relative to the NC group. Consequently, the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (V:C), an indicator of absorptive capacity (Ducatelle et al., 2018), was substantially lower in challenged birds compared to controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 3C). These morphological changes reflect epithelial damage and compensatory crypt cell proliferation typical of enteric infections (Gholamiandehkordi et al., 2007; Williams, 2005).Dietary calcium level and particle size modulate jejunal response to challengeAmong the challenged groups, dietary treatments influenced the severity of jejunal alterations, although pairwise comparisons for cumulative pathology were not significant (P > 0.05). Notably, birds receiving the low calcium, coarse limestone diet (LC) exhibited the lowest mean cumulative pathology score (9.70). Morphometrically, the LC group maintained the longest villi (mean 498 µm) and highest V:C ratio (mean 1.58) among challenged treatments. Dunn's post-hoc tests revealed that villus length and V:C ratio in the LC group were significantly higher than in the reduced calcium, coarse limestone group (RC; mean villus length 413 µm, P = 0.004; mean V:C ratio 1.27, P = 0.001). These observations suggest that low dietary calcium combined with coarse limestone may partially mitigate challenge-induced damage compared to other challenged groups, potentially through mechanisms involving calcium availability, luminal pH, or microbiota modulation (Paiva et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2018). Conversely, the RC group showed the most pronounced negative morphological impact (shortest villi, lowest V:C ratio) among challenged birds. No consistent main effects of limestone particle size were evident across all parameters within the same calcium level.General microbiota composition and impact of enteric challenge on diversitySequencing of the 16S rRNA gene yielded an average of 57,437 reads per sample. After rarefaction to 24,791 reads to normalize sequencing depth, 65 of 70 samples (92.9%) were retained for diversity analysis, identifying 2,391 unique ASVs across all samples. Consistent with previous studies in broilers (Borda-Molina et al., 2018; Oakley et al., 2014; Pan & Yu, 2014), the jejunal microbiota was heavily dominated by Firmicutes (>93%), primarily the family Lactobacillaceae (~90%) and genus Lactobacillus (~90%) (Fig. 4, 5, 6). Proteobacteria (mainly Escherichia-Shigella) constituted the second most abundant phylum (~6%), while Bacteroidota and Actinobacteriota were minor members (<0.2%).Alpha diversity analysis revealed significant differences among treatment groups in Observed ASV richness (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.001) and Fisher's alpha diversity (P = 0.002), while Shannon and Simpson diversity indices showed no significant differences (P > 0.10) (Fig. 7). Post-hoc Dunn's tests indicated that both LF and RC treatments had significantly lower Observed ASV richness compared to the unchallenged control (NC) group (Padj = 0.008 and Padj = 0.017, respectively) and the adequate calcium, fine particle challenged group (AF) (Padj = 0.008 and Padj = 0.012, respectively). Dietary calcium concentration also significantly influenced jejunal microbial richness (Observed ASVs, P = 0.040; Fisher's alpha, P = 0.037; Kruskal-Wallis main effect test excluding NC). Adequate calcium diets supported higher microbial richness compared to low calcium diets (Fig. 7A, 7D), with post-hoc Dunn's tests showing adequate calcium had significantly higher Fisher's alpha than low calcium (Padj = 0.043). Limestone particle size did not significantly influence alpha diversity measures (Kruskal-Wallis P > 0.31). These findings suggest that the enteric challenge reduced richness, particularly under specific low and reduced calcium conditions, while adequate dietary calcium helped maintain richness (Paiva et al., 2013).The Eimeria spp. and C. perfringens co-infection significantly altered the overall jejunal microbial ecosystem structure. Beta diversity analysis revealed distinct clustering based on treatment groups across multiple distance metrics, including Bray-Curtis (PERMANOVA, P = 0.001), Jaccard (P = 0.001), and Unweighted UniFrac (P = 0.009), while Weighted UniFrac showed no significant difference (P = 0.335) (Fig. 8). Pairwise PERMANOVA indicated that the NC group differed significantly from challenged treatments, particularly LF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.001) and RC (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.018), but also RF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.001), AC (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.005), and LC (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.005). Although calcium concentration and particle size did not show statistically significant main effects on overall community structure (PERMANOVA P > 0.10 and P > 0.27, respectively), specific pairwise comparisons between challenged groups revealed dietary influences, such as AF clustering separately from RF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.043) and LF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.039) (Fig. 8). This clear separation between NC and challenged groups signifies a substantial challenge-induced shift in microbial structure, a common feature of enteric diseases and dysbiosis (Antonissen et al., 2016; Ducatelle et al., 2018), aligning with the observed jejunal pathology (Fig. 2, 3).Dietary calcium and challenge status drive differential taxon abundanceDifferential abundance analysis using DESeq2 identified specific ASVs responsive to dietary treatments and challenge status (Fig. 9). Comparing NC to challenged groups revealed significant shifts. Notably, Romboutsia was highly abundant in NC but significantly depleted in AF (Padj < 0.001, log2FC = -44.74). Conversely, several Lactobacillus and Bacillus were significantly depleted in NC compared to specific challenged groups (e.g., NC vs AF: Lactobacillus Padj < 0.001, Bacillus Padj < 0.001 and Padj = 0.043; NC vs AC: Lactobacillus Padj < 0.001, Staphylococcus Padj = 0.019; NC vs LC: Bacillus Padj < 0.001). At the phylum level, Bacteroidota abundance was significantly higher in NC compared to challenged groups RF (Padj = 0.001) and RC (Padj = 0.014). The higher relative abundance of potentially beneficial butyrate-producing families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, as well as the immunomodulatory Candidatus Arthromitus (Bortoluzzi et al., 2018) in the NC group compared to most challenged groups (Fig. 5, 6), further underscores the challenge effect, although these differences were not significant at the family level in the DESeq2 analysis (Padj > 0.10).Within challenged groups, dietary calcium levels drove significant changes. Several Lactobacillus were significantly enriched in adequate (AF) and reduced (RF) calcium groups compared to the low calcium group (LF) when using fine particles (Padj < 0.001), suggesting adequate calcium supports these dominant commensals (Pan & Yu, 2014). Clostridium sensu stricto 1 showed a strong positive association with calcium, being significantly higher in AC compared to RC (Padj < 0.001, log2FC = 21.88) but depleted in RC compared to LC (Padj < 0.001, log2FC = -12.33). This genus includes important butyrate producers, aligning with predicted functional data (Bortoluzzi et al., 2018). Additionally, the Romboutsia mentioned above was higher in RC compared to RF (Padj < 0.001, log2FC = 40.97). Certain potentially pathogenic Gallibacterium were enriched in RF compared to LF (Padj = 0.001 and Padj = 0.002). These ASV level differences reflect highly specific microbial responses to dietary calcium levels and the enteric challenge.Predicted[RWT1] functional consequences of microbiota shiftsPICRUSt2 analysis predicted functional differences across treatment groups based on 16S rRNA data (Fig. 11). Comparing the challenged AF group to the unchallenged NC group showed significant downregulation of predicted pathways related to bacterial secretion systems and cell cycle regulation (e.g., Cell cycle - Caulobacter, FoldEnrichment = 26.48, P < 0.001) in AF, suggesting altered bacterial activity post-infection. Adequate calcium treatments significantly upregulated predicted starch and sucrose metabolism compared to lower calcium diets (Padj < 0.01, Fold enrichment > 4.2). Crucially, predicted butanoate (butyrate) metabolism pathways were significantly enriched in higher calcium treatments (AF, AC, RC), particularly with coarse particles (e.g., AC vs RC, P < 0.001, Fold enrichment 7.0), consistent with the higher abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 ASVs. This suggests adequate calcium, especially from coarse limestone, promotes potential butyrate production, vital for gut health (Dittoe et al., 2018). Adequate calcium treatments also enriched predicted pathways for biofilm formation (e.g., AF vs RF, P < 0.001) and antimicrobial peptide resistance (e.g., AF vs RF, P < 0.001), potentially contributing to community resilience. Furthermore, the enrichment of secondary bile acid biosynthesis in adequate calcium groups (e.g., AF vs RF, Padj < 0.01) suggests an enhanced capacity to modulate host bile acids, potentially impacting pathogen resistance (Ducatelle et al., 2018).Segment specific transcriptional landscapes reveal distinct adaptations to enteric challenge and dietary calciumTo understand the host mucosal response at the molecular level, we performed mRNA sequencing on jejunal (n=69) and cecal (n=70) tissues. This yielded high-quality transcriptomic data with average 47.1 million reads per sample and a 77% mean alignment rate, allowing for differential gene expression (DEG) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).Enteric challenge elicits divergent jejunal and cecal transcriptional programsThe Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection provoked the most substantial transcriptomic alterations when comparing challenged birds fed adequate calcium and fine limestone (AF) to unchallenged controls (NC; Fig. 12A, 12C). A large number of genes were differentially expressed in both the jejunum (721 DEGs; 202 up, 519 down; Padj < 0.05) and cecum (603 DEGs; 183 up, 420 down; Padj < 0.05) (Table 1, 2). The marked prevalence of downregulated genes (70-72%) across both segments suggests a broad suppression of normal physiological functions, possibly reflecting pathogen mediated tissue damage or a systemic host strategy to conserve resources during infection (Jia et al., 2019; Truong et al., 2017). Only a small subset of DEGs overlapped between tissues (34 upregulated, 55 downregulated), indicating largely distinct segment specific responses.Despite this general downregulation, GSEA using Hallmark pathways revealed distinct functional priorities between the segments (Fig. 12B, 12D). The cecum mounted a strong immune-dominant response, characterized by highly significant enrichment of interferon pathways including both IFN-? and IFN-?, TNF? signaling via NF?B, inflammatory response, and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling (NES > 1.8, FDR < 0.05). This robust immune activation aligns with the cecum's role as a major site of microbial interaction and immune sampling in poultry (Kogut et al., 2018; Oakley & Kogut, 2016). Conversely, the jejunum prioritized epithelial cell proliferation and turnover, indicated by the strong enrichment of MYC targets, E2F targets, and G2M checkpoint pathways (NES > 2.0, FDR < 0.05). This proliferative response is likely a crucial mechanism to repair the epithelial damage inflicted by Eimeria replication and subsequent C. perfringens activity (Cooper & Songer, 2009; Williams, 2005). Shared responses included upregulated stress pathways like apoptosis and p53 signaling, alongside metabolic shifts involving oxidative phosphorylation, cholesterol homeostasis, and glycolysis, indicating core cellular stress and altered energy demands common to both segments during infection (Jia et al., 2019; Truong et al., 2017). Segment-specific metabolic reprogramming was also apparent; the cecum uniquely upregulated xenobiotic and heme metabolism, possibly reflecting its role in detoxifying microbial products (Borda-Molina et al., 2018). These divergent transcriptional signatures underscore the specialized roles and adaptive responses of the jejunum and cecum to enteric insults.Calcium restriction drives complex, threshold dependent, and reciprocal jejunal cecal adaptationsCompared to the challenge itself, dietary calcium manipulations resulted in fewer DEGs (Fig. 13, 14; Table 1, 2) but induced significant pathway level reprogramming, particularly evident through GSEA. These responses were often segment specific and depended on both the level of calcium restriction and the limestone particle size.For the diets containing fine limestone particles reducing dietary calcium triggered reciprocal adaptations between segments (Fig. 15). Moderate restriction (RF vs AF) enhanced jejunal cell proliferation pathways like MYC targets, E2F targets, and G2M checkpoint while suppressing immune pathways such as IFN and TNF? signaling. In contrast, the cecum suppressed proliferation but upregulated metabolic pathways including bile acid metabolism and peroxisome function. Severe restriction (LF vs RF) reversed this pattern: the jejunum suppressed proliferation and activated immune signaling involving IFN, TNF?, and TGF-? pathways, while the cecum upregulated proliferation pathways. This suggests a complex, potentially compensatory, interplay between intestinal segments under varying calcium availability (Mann et al., 2014).Using coarse limestone particles in diet elicited different adaptive responses (Fig. 16). Moderate calcium restriction (RC vs AC) led to widespread suppression of metabolic, immune, and stress pathways in the jejunum (30 downregulated pathways), indicating functional impairment. The cecum, however, showed adaptive conditioning, suppressing proliferation but enhancing stress responses like hypoxia and p53 signaling, along with specific metabolic pathways including oxidative phosphorylation and bile acid metabolism. Remarkably, severe restriction (LC vs RC) triggered a strong compensatory upregulation in the jejunum (38 pathways), restoring previously suppressed functions, while the cecum continued towards metabolic specialization and immunosuppression. This highlights a threshold effect potentially linked to the slower calcium release from coarse particles (Kim et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018), influencing how each segment adapts to restriction (Paiva et al., 2013; Paiva et al., 2013).Coarse limestone enhances jejunal immune programming during challengeComparing coarse versus fine limestone at adequate calcium levels under challenge (AC vs AF) revealed striking segment-specific effects (Fig. 15, 16). The jejunum receiving coarse particles (AC) showed robust activation, with 23 pathways upregulated and none downregulated. This response was dominated by enhanced immune defenses such as IFN signaling, inflammatory response, and TNF? signaling, alongside stress responses including hypoxia and p53 signaling, and tissue remodeling pathways like EMT and apical junction regulation. This suggests coarse particles prime the jejunum for heightened immune vigilance. Conversely, the cecum exhibited suppressed inflammatory and stress responses while enhancing proliferative capacity, indicated by enrichment of G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, and MYC target pathways. This dichotomy implies differential calcium sensing or utilization based on particle solubility (Zhang & Coon, 1997). Slower calcium release from coarse particles might support sustained jejunal immune functions or barrier integrity (Oh et al., 2018), while concurrently promoting compensatory regeneration in the cecum. This coordinated response could optimize overall intestinal resilience during challenge.ConclusionThis study integrates analyses of host pathology, microbiota composition, and segment-specific mucosal transcriptomes to dissect the impact of dietary calcium concentration and limestone particle size on the broiler gut ecosystem during an Eimeria and C. perfringens co-infection. We demonstrate that the enteric challenge induces significant jejunal lesions and dysbiosis, characterized by altered microbial community structure, reduced richness, and shifts in key taxa, alongside profound, segment specific host transcriptional reprogramming dominated by immune activation in the cecum and proliferation and repair processes in the jejunum.Crucially, manipulating calcium availability through dietary concentration and limestone particle size significantly modulates these responses. Adequate calcium levels generally supported higher microbial richness and abundances of beneficial genera like Lactobacillus and Clostridium sensu stricto 1, correlating with enriched predicted butyrate metabolism. Coarse limestone particles, particularly at adequate calcium concentrations, promoted more integrated microbial networks and enhanced jejunal immune pathway activation during the challenge. Conversely, calcium restriction elicited complex, threshold dependent adaptations, including reciprocal transcriptional responses between the jejunum and cecum. Specific combinations, such as low calcium with coarse limestone, partially mitigated the severity of jejunal histopathology compared to other challenged groups.Collectively, these findings reveal the intricate interplay between dietary mineral characteristics, the gut microbiota, and host mucosal responses in different intestinal segments during polymicrobial challenge. Optimizing dietary calcium concentration and limestone particle size emerges as a viable nutritional strategy to enhance gut health and resilience in poultry facing enteric disease pressure, particularly in production systems limiting antibiotic use.[RWT1]Has to again look back at the orignal results.
