General microbiota composition and impact of enteric challenge on diversity
Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene yielded an average of 57,437 reads per sample. After rarefaction to 24,791 reads to normalize sequencing depth, 65 of 70 samples (92.9%) were retained for diversity analysis, identifying 2,391 unique ASVs across all samples. Consistent with previous studies in broilers (Borda-Molina et al., 2018; Oakley et al., 2014; Pan & Yu, 2014), the jejunal microbiota was heavily dominated by Firmicutes (>93%), primarily the family Lactobacillaceae (~90%) and genus Lactobacillus (~90%) (Fig. 4, 5, 6). Proteobacteria (mainly Escherichia-Shigella) constituted the second most abundant phylum (~6%), while Bacteroidota and Actinobacteriota were minor members (<0.2%).
Alpha diversity analysis revealed significant differences among treatment groups in Observed ASV richness (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.001) and Fisher's alpha diversity (P = 0.002), while Shannon and Simpson diversity indices showed no significant differences (P > 0.10) (Fig. 7). Post-hoc Dunn's tests indicated that both LF and RC treatments had significantly lower Observed ASV richness compared to the unchallenged control (NC) group (Padj = 0.008 and Padj = 0.017, respectively) and the adequate calcium, fine particle challenged group (AF) (Padj = 0.008 and Padj = 0.012, respectively). Dietary calcium concentration also significantly influenced jejunal microbial richness (Observed ASVs, P = 0.040; Fisher's alpha, P = 0.037; Kruskal-Wallis main effect test excluding NC). Adequate calcium diets supported higher microbial richness compared to low calcium diets (Fig. 7A, 7D), with post-hoc Dunn's tests showing adequate calcium had significantly higher Fisher's alpha than low calcium (Padj = 0.043). Limestone particle size did not significantly influence alpha diversity measures (Kruskal-Wallis P > 0.31). These findings suggest that the enteric challenge reduced richness, particularly under specific low and reduced calcium conditions, while adequate dietary calcium helped maintain richness (Paiva et al., 2013).
The Eimeria spp. and C. perfringens co-infection significantly altered the overall jejunal microbial ecosystem structure. Beta diversity analysis revealed distinct clustering based on treatment groups across multiple distance metrics, including Bray-Curtis (PERMANOVA, P = 0.001), Jaccard (P = 0.001), and Unweighted UniFrac (P = 0.009), while Weighted UniFrac showed no significant difference (P = 0.335) (Fig. 8). Pairwise PERMANOVA indicated that the NC group differed significantly from challenged treatments, particularly LF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.001) and RC (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.018), but also RF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.001), AC (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.005), and LC (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.005). Although calcium concentration and particle size did not show statistically significant main effects on overall community structure (PERMANOVA P > 0.10 and P > 0.27, respectively), specific pairwise comparisons between challenged groups revealed dietary influences, such as AF clustering separately from RF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.043) and LF (Bray-Curtis Padj = 0.039) (Fig. 8). This clear separation between NC and challenged groups signifies a substantial challenge-induced shift in microbial structure, a common feature of enteric diseases and dysbiosis (Antonissen et al., 2016; Ducatelle et al., 2018), aligning with the observed jejunal pathology (Fig. 2, 3).
Impact of Enteric Challenge on Jejunal Microbiota and Function (SF vs. NC)
The enteric challenge and dietary interventions induced significant and distinct alterations in the jejunal microbiota composition and its predicted functional landscape. The co-infection with Eimeria and C. perfringens profoundly impacted the jejunal ecosystem. When comparing the challenged group fed adequate calcium with fine limestone (SF) to the unchallenged negative control (NC), two genera showed significant differential abundance (Padj < 0.05). Notably, Romboutsia was drastically depleted in the SF group (log2FC = -38.25, Padj < 0.001). This suppression of a potential commensal underscores the challenge’s disruptive effect on the core microbial community, a finding consistent with general observations of dysbiosis during enteric diseases (Diaz-Carrasco et al., 2019; Stanley et al., 2014). Zampiga et al. (2020) previously linked lower Romboutsia in the ileum with poorer feed efficiency in broiler breeders, suggesting potential performance implications from its depletion here. Conversely, the genus Bacillus was significantly enriched in the SF group, with a high log2FC of 22.10 (Padj < 0.001). This enrichment might reflect opportunistic proliferation in the altered gut environment or a specific adaptation to the challenge. The probiotic potential of some Bacillus species is well documented (Coronado et al., 2023; Mountzouris et al., 2018), but their role when naturally enriched during a co-infection can be complex.
Functionally, the enteric challenge (SF vs. NC) led to the significant upregulation of pathways involved in the biosynthesis of macrolides (Padj = 0.008) and type I polyketide structures (Padj = 0.009). Macrolides and polyketides are diverse classes of secondary metabolites, many of which possess potent antimicrobial properties or can act as virulence factors. Their increased biosynthesis potential in the challenged group (SF) could reflect an intensified competitive environment within the microbiota, where certain microbes upregulate these compounds for defense, antagonism against pathogens, or to modulate the host environment (Li et al., 2023, who noted metabolic shifts under stress). This suggests a shift towards a more biologically active and potentially antagonistic microbial community in response to the pathogenic insult.
2. Microbial and Functional Profiles of Challenged Groups Relative to Unchallenged Controls (NC)
Examining each challenged group against the NC reveals how dietary treatments modulated the gut environment's response to pathogenic pressure.
The most consistent and dramatic change across all challenged groups (SF, RF, LF, SC, RC, LC) compared to NC was the significant depletion of Romboutsia (g__Romboutsia_11 or its parent family Peptostreptococcaceae where genus was not resolved as significantly different but family was). For instance, in RF vs NC, Romboutsia showed a log2FC of -39.29 (padj < 0.001); in LF vs NC, Romboutsia (ASV 0eeb27cf...) had a log2FC of -37.21 (padj < 0.001 for genus); in RC vs NC, an "Unknown_Genus_from_Family_Peptostreptococcaceae" was down with log2FC -34.93 (padj < 0.001); and in LC vs NC, Romboutsia (g__Romboutsia_11) showed log2FC -20.60 (padj = 0.085) [cite: 1802, 1871, 1876, 2074, 1889, 1901, 2449-2450, 2518, 2523, 2603, 2620, 2625, 2633, 2638, 2643, 2211-2217, 2298-2305, 2388-2394, 2471-2477, 2583-2588, 2700-2701, 2707-2710, 2714-2717]. This pervasive depletion underscores a robust challenge effect that dietary interventions did not fully counteract for this genus.
Conversely, the genus Bacillus (g__Bacillus_45) was significantly enriched in RF (log2FC = 19.66, padj = 0.010), LF (log2FC = 21.70, padj < 0.001), RC (log2FC = 18.63, padj < 0.001), and LC (log2FC = 24.75, padj < 0.001) compared to NC. Similarly, Lactobacillus (represented by various ASVs and genus-level aggregations like g__Lactobacillus_151 or g__Lactobacillus_82) was generally more abundant in challenged groups like RF (g__Lactobacillus_151, log2FC = 1.90, padj=1.00 - though not significant, specific ASVs were), LF (g__Lactobacillus_59, log2FC = 2.90, padj = 0.011), SC (g__Lactobacillus_151, log2FC = 2.19, padj=1.00 - ASV c7ac5c... log2FC=24.67, padj < 0.001), and LC (ASV c7ac5c... log2FC=24.59, padj < 0.001) compared to NC.
Functionally, Butanoate metabolism, crucial for epithelial health and immune modulation through the production of butyrate (Antongiovanni et al., 2007; Sugumar et al., 2021), was significantly upregulated in the LF group (p.adjust = 0.015) when compared to NC. This suggests that the low calcium, fine limestone diet may have fostered a microbial community with an enhanced capacity for butyrate production, potentially contributing to gut resilience. In stark contrast, this key metabolic pathway was significantly downregulated in both RF (p.adjust = 0.000) and RC (p.adjust = 0.000) groups relative to NC, indicating a compromised potential for beneficial SCFA production under these specific dietary conditions during challenge. The Biosynthesis of 12-, 14-, and 16-membered macrolides and Type I polyketide structures, initially noted as upregulated in SF vs NC, were also found to be upregulated in LC vs NC (p.adjust = 0.016 and 0.018, respectively) [cite: 4233-4248]. The key orthology driving these pathways was also significantly upregulated in RF vs NC (log2FC = 24.05, padj < 0.001) and RC vs NC (log2FC = 22.81, padj = 0.0013), reinforcing the interpretation of a common microbial stress response or altered inter-microbial competition across multiple challenged groups. Furthermore, Galactose metabolism was significantly upregulated in RF (p.adjust = 0.007), LF (p.adjust = 0.006), and RC (p.adjust = 0.000) groups when compared to NC [cite: 3933-3936, 4017-4020, 4137-4140]. This consistent shift in galactose processing, along with upregulated Fructose and mannose metabolism in RF and LF vs NC (p.adjust ≤ 0.001), suggests a broad alteration in carbohydrate utilization strategies by the microbiota in response to the enteric challenge. This could reflect changes in substrate availability from damaged intestinal mucosa or altered host secretions, or a shift in microbial preference for readily fermentable sugars. For example, studies have shown that during enteric stress, the host may increase mucus production, providing glycoproteins that can be degraded into simpler sugars like galactose and mannose by the microbiota (Sicard et al., 2017).
3. Effects of Dietary Calcium Concentration and Limestone Particle Size on Challenged Birds
* A. Influence of Calcium Concentration with Fine Limestone Particles (SF vs. RF vs. LF):
Within fine limestone diets, reducing calcium from adequate (SF) to reduced (RF) did not lead to significant changes at the genus level according to the summary table. Functionally, however, this reduction (RF vs SF) downregulated pathways for Basal transcription factors (p.adjust = 0.004) and Nucleotide excision repair (p.adjust = 0.004) [cite: 3484-3490]. This suggests that even a moderate calcium reduction might impair fundamental bacterial cellular processes like gene expression and DNA repair capacity under challenge, potentially leading to a less robust or adaptable microbiota.
A further reduction to low calcium (LF) significantly depleted several Lactobacillus genera (e.g., g__Lactobacillus_85, log2FC = -22.37; g__Lactobacillus_77, log2FC = -22.13; all padj < 0.001) when compared to RF. Similarly, these Lactobacillus genera were significantly lower in LF compared to SF (e.g., g__Lactobacillus_85, log2FC = -25.51, padj < 0.001). This indicates that higher calcium levels (adequate and reduced) better supported these key commensals than low calcium when fine limestone was used, aligning with literature showing calcium's influence on Lactobacillus (Pan & Yu, 2014). Conversely, Gallibacterium (g__Gallibacterium_21 and g__Gallibacterium_23) was significantly less abundant in LF compared to RF (log2FC = -25.10 and -23.37 respectively, padj ≤ 0.002). Functionally, in LF vs RF, Fructose and mannose metabolism (p.adjust = 0.024), Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism (p.adjust = 0.015), and Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism (p.adjust = 0.016) were upregulated, while Sulfur metabolism (p.adjust = 0.002) was downregulated [cite: 3510, 3521-3523]. Taurine metabolism is involved in bile acid conjugation and has antioxidant properties; its upregulation in LF could be a response to oxidative stress or altered bile acid profiles. The downregulation of sulfur metabolism, crucial for synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids like methionine and cysteine, might indicate a limitation in these key nutrients or a shift away from their synthesis. The upregulation of various carbohydrate and amino acid-related metabolic pathways in LF compared to SF (e.g., Fructose and mannose metabolism, p.adjust = 0.000; Pentose and glucuronate interconversions, p.adjust = 0.003; Cysteine and methionine metabolism, p.adjust = 0.005) [cite: 3528-3531, 3533-3536, 3547-3550] suggests significant metabolic restructuring towards utilizing alternative energy sources and synthesizing essential amino acids under severe calcium restriction with fine limestone.
* B. Influence of Calcium Concentration with Coarse Limestone Particles (SC vs. RC vs. LC):
With coarse limestone, Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (ASV 14dca...) was significantly lower in RC compared to SC (log2FC = -21.88, padj < 0.001), but then significantly higher in LC compared to RC (log2FC = 29.20, padj < 0.001). This non-linear response of a key butyrate producer (MiDAS Field Guide, n.d.; Ribeiro et al., 2022) is noteworthy.
Functionally, the RC group exhibited a dramatic downregulation of numerous core metabolic pathways compared to SC, including Butanoate metabolism (p.adjust = 0.001), Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (p.adjust = 0.000), Propanoate metabolism (p.adjust = 0.001), Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation (amino acid catabolism, p.adjust = 0.002), Pyruvate metabolism (central energy pathway, p.adjust = 0.019), Arginine biosynthesis (amino acid synthesis, p.adjust = 0.020), Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (amino acid metabolism, p.adjust = 0.020), and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis (central carbohydrate metabolism, p.adjust = 0.043) [cite: 3599, 3589-3592, 3603-3606, 3611-3614, 3615-3618, 3619-3622, 3623-3626, 3645-3648]. This general metabolic suppression in RC suggests a severely compromised microbial functional state, likely impacting energy generation and SCFA production, when calcium is reduced with coarse particles. In stark contrast, the LC group showed a widespread and significant upregulation of these very same pathways when compared to RC, including Butanoate metabolism (p.adjust = 0.000), Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation (p.adjust = 0.000), and Biosynthesis of amino acids (p.adjust = 0.000) [cite: 3664-3667, 3661-3663, 3668-3671]. This indicates a remarkable metabolic rebound and enhancement in the LC group, potentially fueled by the altered availability of calcium from coarse particles under low dietary inclusion. When comparing LC directly to SC, pathways like Quorum sensing (p.adjust = 0.000), Oxidative phosphorylation (p.adjust = 0.003), Arginine and proline metabolism (p.adjust = 0.008), Tryptophan metabolism (p.adjust = 0.009), and Butanoate metabolism (p.adjust = 0.027) were upregulated in LC. However, Other carbon fixation pathways (p.adjust = 0.000) and the Citrate cycle (p.adjust = 0.000) were downregulated in LC vs SC [cite: 3739-3742, 3743-3746, 3747-3750, 3751-3754, 3759-3762, 3777-3780, 3785-3788], suggesting a specialized, rather than universally enhanced, metabolic profile in the LC group compared to adequate calcium with coarse particles, possibly indicating a shift towards anaerobic fermentation pathways and specific amino acid utilization.
* C. Influence of Limestone Particle Size at Different Calcium Levels:
Limestone particle size interacted significantly with calcium levels to shape microbial functions.
At adequate calcium (SC vs. SF), coarse limestone (SC) was associated with downregulation of Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) biosynthesis (p.adjust = 0.029), Steroid degradation (p.adjust = 0.041), and Biosynthesis of 12-, 14-, and 16-membered macrolides (p.adjust = 0.041) compared to fine (SF) [cite: 3826-3836]. LAM is a major cell wall component of some bacteria and can modulate host immune responses. Reduced LAM biosynthesis with coarse particles might suggest altered bacterial cell wall structures or different immunomodulatory properties of the microbiota. Steroid degradation, often linked to bile acid metabolism by gut microbes (Wells et al., 2021), being lower in SC could imply differences in how the microbiota interacts with host bile acids depending on limestone particle size.
At reduced calcium (RC vs. RF), coarse limestone (RC) showed upregulation of Plant-pathogen interaction pathways (p.adjust = 0.006), which can encompass a wide range of microbial interactions with plant-derived compounds from feed or host-derived factors. Conversely, Histidine metabolism (p.adjust = 0.013) and Biofilm formation - Vibrio cholerae (p.adjust = 0.015) were downregulated in RC [cite: 3839-3842, 3845-3852]. Reduced biofilm formation potential could indicate less stable microbial communities with coarse particles under reduced calcium, potentially making them more susceptible to environmental shifts.
At low calcium (LC vs. LF), coarse limestone (LC) led to upregulation of Oxidative phosphorylation (p.adjust = 0.000) and Cysteine and methionine metabolism (p.adjust = 0.008) [cite: 3857-3864]. Enhanced oxidative phosphorylation suggests an increased capacity for aerobic energy generation by some members of the microbiota, while increased cysteine and methionine metabolism points to enhanced synthesis or utilization of these crucial sulfur-containing amino acids.
These functional shifts emphasize the complex interplay where particle size, by influencing mineral dissolution and availability (Kim et al., 2018; Zhang & Coon, 1997), differentially modulates the metabolic activities of the jejunal microbiota depending on the overall dietary calcium level.
