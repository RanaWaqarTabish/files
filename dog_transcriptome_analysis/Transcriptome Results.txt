ResultsDifferential Gene Expression AnalysismRNA sequencing of jejunal (n=69) and cecal (n=70) mucosal tissues across experimental groups generated an average of 47.1 million paired-end reads per sample (range: 22.6Ð77.7 million). After quality control and alignment to the Gallus gallus reference genome (GRCg7b), the mean alignment rate was 77.0%, with tissue-specific rates of 78.9% in jejunum and 74.9% in cecum.Differential gene expression analysis revealed pronounced transcriptomic alterations in response to the enteric challenge. The most substantial changes occurred when comparing the challenged (Standard Calcium with Fine Limestone Particles; SF) group with the unchallenged control (NC) groups across both tissues. In the jejunum, this comparison identified 721 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Padj < 0.05), including 202 genes (28%) upregulated and 519 genes (72%) downregulated. In the cecum, 603 DEGs were identified, with 183 genes (30%) upregulated and 420 genes (70%) downregulated. This widespread downregulation in both tissues suggests a potential suppression of normal physiological functions in response to the enteric challenge. Overlap analysis between tissues showed that, among the downregulated genes, 55 DEGs (6.2% of all downregulated DEGs) were shared between the jejunum and cecum, primarily involved in metabolism and ion signaling, while for upregulated genes, 34 DEGs (9.7% of all upregulated DEGs) were common to both tissues, largely associated with immune response and cell cycle regulation, highlighting overlapping transcriptional responses to enteric challenge.The comparison among the dietary treatments showed substantially fewer transcriptional changes compared to the challenge response. In jejunal tissue, the most notable gene expression changes occurred in the LF vs RF (Low Calcium compared to Reduced Calcium) comparison (40 DEGs; 12 upregulated, 28 downregulated) and RC vs SC (Coarse Limestone Particles) comparison (25 DEGs; 18 upregulated, 7 downregulated). Very few transcriptional changes were detected in SC vs SF (3 DEGs), LC vs RC (2 DEGs), and LF vs SF (1 DEG) comparisons. No significant differential expression was observed in the remaining dietary comparisons (RF vs SF, LC vs SC, RC vs RF, and LC vs LF).In cecal tissue, the comparison between LC and SC yielded the most pronounced differences with 92 DEGs evenly distributed between up- and downregulated genes. SC vs SF comparison revealed 16 DEGs (11 upregulated, 5 downregulated). Minimal transcriptional alterations were observed in LF vs SF (9 DEGs), RC vs SC (4 DEGs), and RC vs RF (3 DEGs). The remaining dietary comparisons (RF vs SF, LF vs RF, and LC vs RC) yielded no statistically significant DEGs. These results indicate that variations in dietary calcium levels and particle sizes generally produced modest transcriptomic effects relative to the primary challenge response.Gene Set Enrichment Analysis In dietary intervention studies involving mild disease challenge models, transcriptional responses are often subtle and may remain undetected after multiple hypothesis testing corrections, as the biological differences are modest compared to the variability among biological replicates. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) provides increased sensitivity for detecting coordinated changes in functionally related gene sets (Mitchell et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2005). Using hallmark gene sets from MSigDB, we identified significant pathway enrichment (FDR < 0.05) in response to both enteric challenge and calcium interventions. The most prominent pathway enrichment was observed between challenged (SF) and unchallenged control (NC) groups in both intestinal segments, with dietary interventions also driving distinct pathway modulation patterns in jejunal and cecal tissues.Immune-Dominant Cecal versus Proliferative Jejunal Response to Enteric ChallengeSubclinical enteric challenge induced fundamentally different transcriptional responses in jejunal and cecal tissues (SF vs NC). Cecal mucosa demonstrated greater transcriptional responce with 30 significantly upregulated and 2 downregulated pathways, compared to jejunum's 19 upregulated and 1 downregulated pathways (FDR < 0.05). Each segment prioritized distinct biological processes during challenge. Interferon signaling pathways (both alpha and gamma) ranked as the most significantly enriched pathways in cecum, indicating an immune-surveillance dominant response. In contrast, MYC targets V1 showed the strongest enrichment in jejunum, highlighting epithelial proliferation as its primary adaptation strategy. Despite these different priorities, both segments shared core innate immune responses, including significant upregulation of TNF? signaling via NF?B pathway, inflammatory response gene sets, and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling cascade.Segment-specific stress adaptation mechanisms were evident in the response to challenge. While oxidative phosphorylation was prominently upregulated in both tissues, cecum uniquely showed enrichment of hypoxia pathway and stronger reactive oxygen species pathway activation. Both segments upregulated apoptosis and p53 pathways, indicating shared stress-induced cell turnover processes. Metabolic reprogramming displayed similar segment specificity. While both segments upregulated cholesterol homeostasis and glycolysis, cecum exhibited stronger enrichment of fatty acid metabolism and uniquely upregulated xenobiotic and heme metabolism pathways, reflecting its greater exposure to microbial metabolites. Cell cycle regulation likewise showed segment-specific patterns, with jejunum predominantly upregulating E2F targets and G2M checkpoint pathways, while cecum significantly enriched TGF-beta signaling and mitotic spindle organization. Both segments downregulated pancreas beta cell pathways, while cecum uniquely downregulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Calcium Restriction with Fine Limestone Particles Elicits Reciprocal Jejunal-Cecal AdaptationsWhen calcium was restricted using fine limestone particles, jejunal and cecal tissues demonstrated opposing transcriptional responses, revealing a reciprocal adaptation strategy between intestinal segments. During transition from standard to reduced dietary calcium (RF vs SF), jejunum enhanced cell proliferation pathways (upregulated E2F targets, MYC targets, G2M checkpoint) while suppressing immune responses (downregulated interferon signaling, TNF? pathway). In stark contrast, cecum downregulated proliferative mechanisms (E2F targets, MYC targets, G2M checkpoint) while enhancing metabolic adaptation pathways (upregulated bile acid metabolism, peroxisome function, angiogenesis). This fundamental difference suggests that moderate calcium restriction triggers a proliferation-focused response in jejunum versus a metabolic adaptation-centered response in cecum.Further reduction from reduced to low calcium levels (LF vs RF) triggered a remarkable compensatory reversal between segments. Jejunal mucosa suppressed previously enhanced proliferative pathways while activating immune signaling (upregulated interferon, TNF?, TGF-beta pathways). Conversely, cecal mucosa upregulated previously suppressed proliferation-associated pathways (E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, MYC targets). This reciprocal reprogramming indicates a complex compensatory relationship between jejunum and cecum under severe calcium restriction. Direct comparison between standard and low calcium (LF vs SF) revealed the most pronounced segment-specific differences, with jejunum exhibiting extensive reprogramming (23 pathways) emphasizing immune activation and metabolic adaptation at the expense of cellular proliferation. Cecum showed a more focused response (10 pathways) characterized by downregulation of both proliferative and immune functions, with only pancreas beta cells and UV response downregulated pathways significantly upregulated under severe calcium restriction.Transcriptional analysis revealed distinct calcium concentration thresholds for pathway modulation. Jejunal proliferation pathways remained robust under moderate calcium restriction but collapsed under severe restriction, while cecal proliferation initially declined under moderate restriction but demonstrated compensatory upregulation under severe restriction. Similarly, jejunal immune pathways showed progressive enhancement with calcium restriction, while cecal immune functions exhibited progressive suppression with increasing calcium restriction.Calcium Restriction with Coarse Limestone Particles Drive Threshold-Dependent Intestinal AdaptationsWhen calcium was restricted using coarse limestone particles, a different pattern of tissue-specific adaptation emerged. Jejunal and cecal mucosa revealed starkly divergent responses when transitioning from standard to reduced calcium (RC vs SC). Jejunum demonstrated extensive suppression with 30 significantly downregulated pathways encompassing cellular metabolism (MYC targets, MTORC1, oxidative phosphorylation), immune responses, and stress adaptation mechanisms, with no upregulated pathways. This widespread suppression suggested profound functional impairment. Cecum exhibited a predominantly activating response with 19 upregulated and 5 downregulated pathways. While proliferative pathways were suppressed in cecum, it showed enhanced stress responses (hypoxia, p53, apoptosis), immune signaling (TGF-beta, TNF?), and metabolic processes (oxidative phosphorylation, bile acid metabolism), indicating adaptive conditioning despite reduced proliferative capacity.Further reduction from reduced to low calcium (LC vs RC) triggered remarkable segment-specific adaptations. Jejunum exhibited an extraordinary compensatory response with 38 significantly upregulated pathways and no downregulation, restoring and enhancing virtually all previously suppressed functions. This paradoxical reversal suggests a complex threshold-dependent adaptation triggered by severe calcium restriction. In contrast, cecal mucosa showed continued remodeling with 4 upregulated and 8 downregulated pathways, further suppressing immune functions (allograft rejection, inflammatory response) and proliferation while enhancing specialized metabolic pathways (xenobiotic metabolism, bile acid metabolism), indicating progressive immunosuppression with metabolic specialization.The cumulative effect of transitioning from standard to low calcium (LC vs SC) resulted in distinct endpoint phenotypes. Jejunal tissue showed moderate transcriptional alterations (6 down, 2 up) characterized by impaired energy production, compromised DNA integrity, and altered lipid processing. Cecal tissue exhibited more extensive reprogramming (20 up, 8 down) featuring suppressed proliferation and immune function alongside broadly enhanced metabolic adaptation and stress responses. These divergent segment-specific adaptations reflect the distinct physiological roles of each intestinal region, with jejunum showing high vulnerability to moderate calcium restriction but remarkable compensatory capacity under severe restriction, while cecum demonstrated greater resilience to moderate calcium restriction and progressively shifted toward metabolic specialization with increasing restriction severity.Coarse Particles Enhance Jejunal Immune ProgrammingJejunal and cecal mucosa demonstrated strikingly opposite responses to limestone particle size during subclinical enteric challenge despite identical calcium concentrations (SC vs SF). Jejunal tissue exposed to coarse particles exhibited robust enhancement of 23 pathways with no downregulation, dominated by activated immune defenses (interferon signaling, inflammatory response, TNF? signaling), stress responses (hypoxia, p53, unfolded protein response), and tissue remodeling mechanisms (epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apical junction). This comprehensive activation suggests coarse particles trigger enhanced jejunal mucosal defense programming.In stark contrast, cecal tissue demonstrated balanced reprogramming with 5 upregulated and 5 downregulated pathways, characterized by suppressed inflammatory/stress responses (TNF?, interferon alpha, hypoxia, p53, apoptosis) and enhanced proliferative capacity (pancreas beta cells, G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, MYC targets V1/V2). This opposing transcriptional signature reveals fundamental differences in segment-specific calcium utilization. This segment-specific response dichotomy suggests an evolved regulatory mechanism whereby coarse particles simultaneously enhance jejunal immune vigilance while promoting cecal regenerative homeostasis during enteric challenge, a complementary adaptation strategy optimizing overall intestinal resilience during dysbiosis conditions.
