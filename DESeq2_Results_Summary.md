# DESeq2 Analysis Results Summary

## Sample and Data Overview

- **Original Metadata Samples**: 144 samples were included in the initial metadata.

- **Filtered Metadata Samples**: After filtering for Negative Control (NC) and Positive Control (PC) treatments and removing samples with undefined tissue types, 36 samples remained (17 jejunum, 6 cecum).

- **HUMAnN3 Pathway Samples**: 102 samples were derived from HUMAnN3 pathway abundance files.

- **Matching Samples**: 23 samples overlapped between metadata and pathway data, comprising 17 jejunum samples (14JF, 17JF, 25JF, 2JF, 37JF, 44JF, 56JF, 57JF, 66JF, 12JF, 21JF, 30JF, 36JF, 43JF, 50JF, 59JF, 68JF) and 6 cecum samples (44CF, 56CF, 12CF, 21CF, 36CF, 43CF).

- **Pathway Filtering**: After pre-filtering pathways with non-zero counts in at least two samples, 427 pathways were retained for analysis.

- **Sparsity in Jejunum**: The jejunum count matrix had 52.05% zero values, indicating moderate sparsity.


## Differential Expression Analysis

Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 to compare pathway abundances between Positive Control (PC) and Negative Control (NC) treatments in jejunum and cecum tissues separately. Pathways with a sum of counts less than 10 across samples were excluded, and size factors were estimated using the 'poscounts' method to handle sparse data.


### Jejunum Results

- **Sample Size**: 17 samples (9 NC, 8 PC, inferred from balanced design).

- **Findings**: No pathways were significantly differentially expressed between PC and NC treatments in jejunum tissue (all adjusted p-values, `padj`, approximately 0.998). This suggests that the PC treatment did not significantly alter pathway abundances in the jejunum compared to NC.

### Cecum Results

- **Sample Size**: 6 samples (2 NC, 4 PC, inferred from balanced design).

- **Findings**: Several pathways were significantly differentially expressed in the cecum (padj < 0.05), indicating that the PC treatment significantly altered microbial metabolic activity compared to NC.
