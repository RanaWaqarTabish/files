Sequencing and Jejunal Microbial CompositionThe 16S rRNA gene amplicon (V4 Ð V5) sequencing yielded 57,437 ± 3,215 reads per sample (range: 12,188-117,310). After rarefaction to 24,791 reads, 65 of 70 samples (92.86%) were retained for diversity analysis. Sequencing identified 2,391 unique ASVs across all samples. SF treatment contained the highest number of taxa (593 ASVs), while LF contained the lowest (304 ASVs).Taxonomic analysis revealed that the jejunal microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes (93.21% of total sequences), followed by Proteobacteria (6.38%), with Actinobacteriota (0.19%) and Bacteroidota (0.17%) present in lower abundances. Significant differences in Bacteroidota abundance were observed between treatment groups (P = 0.0102), with NC showing significantly higher abundance compared to RC and RF treatments (P < 0.05).At the family level, Lactobacillaceae was the predominant family (89.93%), followed by Enterobacteriaceae (5.75%) and Clostridiaceae (1.25%). The relative abundance of Bacillaceae differed significantly among treatments (P = 0.0201), with LC treatment showing significantly higher abundance compared to LF, RC, and SC treatments. At the genus level, Lactobacillus (90.19%), Escherichia-Shigella (5.71%), and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (1.07%) were most abundant. Similar to family-level observations, Bacillus abundance was significantly higher in LC treatment compared to other treatments (P = 0.0135).NC treatment showed the highest abundance of potentially beneficial bacterial groups, including Lachnospiraceae (0.41%) and Ruminococcaceae (0.21%), which are known for producing short-chain fatty acids. NC treatment also contained notably higher levels of Candidatus_Arthromitus (0.78%), a segmented filamentous bacterium associated with immune development, compared to challenged treatments except SF (0.38%).Alpha Diversity AnalysisAlpha diversity analysis revealed significant differences among treatment groups in both observed species richness (P = 0.0014) and Fisher's alpha diversity (P = 0.0022), while Shannon and Simpson diversity indices showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). NC and SF treatments exhibited the highest observed richness, while LF and RC treatments showed the lowest richness. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that both LF and RC treatments had significantly lower richness compared to NC and SF treatments (P < 0.05). Analysis of main effects demonstrated that calcium concentration significantly affected alpha diversity metrics (P < 0.05), with Standard calcium diets supporting higher microbial richness compared to Low calcium diets (P = 0.0431). Particle size did not significantly influence alpha diversity measures (P > 0.05). These findings suggest that adequate calcium levels in the diet may promote a more diverse jejunal microbiota, potentially supporting intestinal health even under challenge conditions.Beta Diversity AnalysisAnalysis of beta diversity revealed significant differences in microbial community structure among treatment groups across multiple distance metrics, including Bray-Curtis (P = 0.001), Jaccard (P = 0.001), and Unweighted UniFrac (P = 0.009), while Weighted UniFrac showed no significant differences (P = 0.335). The treatment effect explained between 10% and 18% of the variation in microbial community structure, with the strongest effect observed using Bray-Curtis distance (R? = 0.18). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the NC treatment differed significantly from challenged treatments, particularly from LF and RC treatments, which were significantly different across all distance metrics (P < 0.05). Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity showed clear separation between NC and challenged groups, with the first two axes explaining approximately 60% of the total variation. Among challenged groups, SF treatment clustered separately from RF (P = 0.043) and LF (P = 0.039) treatments based on Bray-Curtis distance, suggesting that higher calcium levels influenced community composition. Analysis of main effects showed that calcium concentration had a modest effect on community structure, though not statistically significant across the primary distance metrics (P > 0.05), while limestone particle size had no significant effect on community composition (P > 0.05). These findings indicate that enteric challenge substantially altered the jejunal microbiota structure, and dietary calcium levels may partially modulate these changes.Differential Abundance AnalysisAnalysis of differentially abundant bacterial strains revealed distinct microbial signatures across treatment groups. Several Lactobacillus strains showed significant enrichment in RF compared to LF (log2FC = 21.61-22.58, P < 0.001) and in SF compared to LF (log2FC = 24.38-24.85, P < 0.001), suggesting that both standard and reduced calcium levels promoted specific Lactobacillus populations compared to low calcium diets under challenge conditions. Peptostreptococcaceae strains, particularly those belonging to Romboutsia, were significantly higher in non-challenged control compared to standard calcium treatments (log2FC = 44.74, P < 0.001), and in RC compared to RF (log2FC = 40.97, P < 0.001), indicating these potentially beneficial bacteria may be sensitive to challenge conditions but supported by reduced calcium under challenge.Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 strains were significantly depleted in RC compared to LC (log2FC = -12.33, P < 0.001) and higher in SC compared to RC (log2FC = 21.88, P < 0.001), demonstrating the importance of calcium in supporting this taxonomic group during challenge. Bacillus strains were significantly reduced in NC versus SF (log2FC = -22.00, P < 0.001) and in SC versus LC (log2FC = -23.96, P < 0.001), suggesting these taxa may respond inversely to calcium supplementation. Gallibacterium (family Pasteurellaceae) strains were significantly enriched in RF compared to LF (log2FC = 23.72-25.41, P < 0.01), indicating these potentially pathogenic organisms may be modulated by particle size under reduced calcium conditions.These strain-level differences reflect highly specific responses to dietary calcium levels and challenge status, with evidence that adequate calcium supplementation promotes beneficial Lactobacillus and Clostridium populations while potentially limiting opportunistic taxa.Microbial Co-occurrence Network AnalysisNetwork analysis of jejunal microbiota revealed distinct community structures shaped by calcium concentration and limestone particle size under necrotic enteritis challenge. The unchallenged control (NC) maintained the largest network (391 nodes, 7,349 edges), while the standard calcium with coarse particle treatment (SC) exhibited the highest network density (0.136), indicating the most cohesive community structure despite having fewer nodes (298 nodes, 6,021 edges). Notably, all treatments demonstrated exclusively positive interactions (100%), suggesting cooperative relationships predominate regardless of dietary intervention. Standard calcium treatments showed significantly higher average node degree (41.61 ± 1.69) and network density (0.120 ± 0.022) compared to reduced calcium (27.65 ± 9.35 degree, 0.108 ± 0.004 density) and low calcium treatments (25.94 ± 9.10 degree, 0.104 ± 0.004 density; P < 0.05), while coarse limestone particles consistently enhanced network integration compared to fine particles (density: 0.116 ± 0.018 vs. 0.106 ± 0.006).Taxa network analysis identified treatment-specific hub microorganisms that likely serve as community organizers, with Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (Clostridiaceae) emerging as a consistent keystone taxon across multiple treatments. The SC treatment combined high density with substantial average degree (40.41), suggesting enhanced resilience to pathogenic challenge through strengthened cooperative interactions. Network modularity analysis revealed that while low calcium treatments maintained smaller networks, they exhibited high compartmentalization (LC: 0.833, LF: 0.858 modularity scores), potentially representing specialized functional niches. Taxonomic distribution analysis demonstrated treatment-specific dominant groups: the unchallenged control featured primarily Ruminococcaceae members (Eisenbergiella, Fournierella), while low calcium treatments showed Bacillaceae dominance with multiple Bacillus strains serving as hub taxa in LC treatment. Standard calcium with coarse particles (SC) uniquely promoted beneficial fermenters including Blautia (Lachnospiraceae) alongside Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, potentially facilitating enhanced short-chain fatty acid production and competitive exclusion of pathogens. Fine particle treatments showed greater prominence of Actinobacteria (Corynebacterium) and lactic acid bacteria (Weissella, Lactococcus), demonstrating how calcium solubility influences microbial community organization. These findings suggest standard calcium levels combined with coarse limestone particles optimize jejunal microbiota structure for resilience against necrotic enteritis challenge through promotion of beneficial fermenting bacteria and enhanced community integration.PICRUSt2 Analysis of Predicted MetagenomesPICRUSt2 analysis of predicted metagenomes revealed significant functional differences across treatment groups, highlighting how dietary calcium concentration and limestone particle size shape microbial metabolic capabilities during necrotic enteritis challenge. Comparing standard calcium with fine particles (SF) to the unchallenged control (NC) showed significant enrichment of bacterial secretion systems (12.10-fold, P < 0.001) and cell cycle-Caulobacter pathways (26.48-fold, P < 0.001) in NC, suggesting altered bacterial cell division and communication under challenge conditions. Standard calcium treatments exhibited marked upregulation of starch and sucrose metabolism enzymes compared to reduced (4.25-fold, P < 0.001) and low calcium treatments (5.28-fold, P < 0.01), indicating enhanced carbohydrate utilization. In contrast, comparisons between reduced and low calcium treatments with fine particles (RF vs LF) revealed substantial downregulation of steroid degradation (-3.00-fold, P < 0.01) and taurine metabolism (-4.24-fold, P < 0.001) in LF, pointing to impaired amino acid and lipid metabolism under calcium restriction.The most pronounced functional differences emerged between reduced and low calcium treatments with coarse particles (RC vs LC), with 571 KEGG Orthologs (KOs) significantly downregulated in LC (P < 0.05), and between standard and reduced calcium coarse treatments (SC vs RC), with 156 KOs predominantly upregulated in SC (P < 0.05). Higher calcium treatments consistently enriched histidine metabolism (7.97-fold in SC vs RC, P < 0.001), D-amino acid metabolism (5.25-fold, P < 0.001), and nitrogen cycling pathways (4.56-fold, P < 0.001), suggesting improved amino acid metabolism and nitrogen utilization efficiency with calcium supplementation. Butanoate metabolism was notably enriched in higher calcium treatments (3.42-6.99-fold, P < 0.001), especially with coarse particles, aligning with the prevalence of butyrate-producing Clostridiales. Particle size further influenced metabolic capacity, with fine particles enriching steroid degradation (6.16-fold, P < 0.001) and glycerol-lipid metabolism (6.01-fold, P < 0.01) compared to coarse particles at standard calcium levels.Integrating taxonomic and functional data provided deeper insights into microbial responses. Standard calcium treatments significantly enriched biofilm formation (7.06-fold, P < 0.001) and antimicrobial peptide resistance pathways (7.60-fold, P < 0.001), potentially enhancing community resilience and network density. Bacterial chemotaxis (4.96-18.72-fold) and flagellar assembly (4.69-7.59-fold) were also upregulated in these treatments, corresponding to increased abundance of motile Clostridium species. Coarse particle treatments consistently enriched quorum sensing pathways (3.98-4.43-fold, P < 0.001), supporting enhanced microbial community integration. Secondary bile acid biosynthesis was significantly elevated in standard calcium treatments (3.61-5.98-fold, P < 0.01), suggesting an enhanced capacity to modify host bile acids, which may bolster pathogen resistance via microbe-host interactions.
